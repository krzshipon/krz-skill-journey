### **Scrum Theory**
- **Empiricism**: Scrum is based on the three pillars of empiricismâ€”**transparency**, **inspection**, and **adaptation**.
- **Values**: Commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect.

**Example**:  
"In Scrum, empiricism ensures that decisions are based on observed results rather than speculation. For example, during a sprint review, the team inspects the increment and adapts the product backlog based on stakeholder feedback."

### **Scrum Roles**
1. **Scrum Master**:
   - Facilitates Scrum events.
   - Removes impediments for the team.
   - Ensures the team adheres to Scrum principles.

2. **Product Owner**:
   - Manages the product backlog.
   - Prioritizes work to maximize value.
   - Communicates with stakeholders.

3. **Development Team**:
   - Self-organizing and cross-functional.
   - Delivers a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint.

**Example**:  
"As a Scrum Master, I facilitated daily stand-ups to ensure the team stayed on track and removed impediments like blocked dependencies. The Product Owner prioritized the backlog, and the Development Team delivered a working increment every sprint."

### **Scrum Events**
1. **Sprint**: A time-boxed iteration (usually 2-4 weeks) where the team delivers a product increment.
2. **Sprint Planning**: The team plans the work for the upcoming sprint.
3. **Daily Scrum**: A 15-minute stand-up to synchronize work and plan for the next 24 hours.
4. **Sprint Review**: The team demonstrates the increment to stakeholders and gathers feedback.
5. **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on the sprint and identifies improvements.

**Example**:  
"During sprint planning, we selected user stories from the product backlog and broke them into tasks. In the daily Scrum, each team member answered: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? Are there any blockers? The sprint review and retrospective helped us gather feedback and improve our process."

### **Scrum Artifacts**
1. **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of features, bugs, and technical work.
2. **Sprint Backlog**: The set of product backlog items selected for the sprint, plus a plan for delivering them.
3. **Increment**: The sum of all completed product backlog items at the end of a sprint.

**Example**:  
"The Product Owner maintained the product backlog, ensuring it was prioritized based on business value. During sprint planning, we moved items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog and committed to delivering them by the end of the sprint."

---

### **Definition of Done (DoD)**
- A shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete.
- Ensures transparency and quality.

**Example**:  
"Our Definition of Done included: code reviewed, unit tests passing, documentation updated, and the feature tested on multiple devices. This ensured that every increment was potentially shippable."
