  - `GET /dashboards`: Fetch dashboard data.

---

## **4. Database Design**

---

### **a. PostgreSQL (SQL Database)**
- **Tables**:
  - `users`: Stores user information (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`).
  - `employees`: Stores employee records (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`, `department`).
  - `financials`: Stores financial data (e.g., `id`, `expense`, `revenue`, `date`).

---

### **b. MongoDB (NoSQL Database)**
- **Collections**:
  - `inventory`: Stores inventory details (e.g., `id`, `name`, `quantity`, `supplier`).
  - `sales`: Stores sales data (e.g., `id`, `customer_id`, `order_id`, `amount`).
  - `projects`: Stores project details (e.g., `id`, `name`, `start_date`, `end_date`).

---

## **5. Technologies**
- **Frontend**: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile apps).
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (for microservices).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL).
- **Message Queue**: Kafka (for asynchronous communication).
- **Caching**: Redis (for caching frequently accessed data).

## **6. System Workflow**

1. Admin adds/updates employee records via the Flutter app.
2. The **Employee Service** updates the employee details in the PostgreSQL database.

---

### **c. Inventory Management**

2. The **Project Service** updates the project details in the MongoDB database.

---

### **g. Reporting and Analytics**

---

## **7. Scalability and Reliability**

---

### **a. Horizontal Scaling**

- Use **NGINX** as a load balancer to distribute traffic.

---

### **b. Database Sharding**
- Shard the PostgreSQL database by user ID or department to distribute the load.

---

### **c. Caching**
- Use **Redis** to cache frequently accessed data like inventory levels and financial reports.

---

### **d. Fault Tolerance**
- Use **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker** (e.g., Hystrix) to handle service failures gracefully.
- Use **database replication** for high availability.

---

## **8. Security**

---

### **a. Data Encryption**
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, financial information) using **AES-256**.

---

### **b. Authentication and Authorization**
- Use **Spring Security** with **OAuth 2.0** for user authentication.
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure API communication.

---

### **c. Rate Limiting**
- Implement rate limiting using **Spring Cloud Gateway** to prevent abuse.

---

## **9. Real-Time Updates**
- Use **WebSockets** in Spring Boot to push real-time updates to the Flutter app (e.g., inventory alerts, project updates).

---

## **10. Summary**
This system design for an **ERP System** uses **Flutter** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. It is **scalable**, **reliable**, and **secure**, leveraging modern technologies like **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **WebSockets** to handle high traffic and real-time updates.
