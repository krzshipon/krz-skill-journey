## **1. Requirements**
### **Functional Requirements**
1. **Flight Management**:
   - Add, update, and delete flight schedules.
   - Display real-time flight status (e.g., on-time, delayed, canceled).
2. **User Management**:
   - Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
3. **Booking Management**:
   - Users can search for flights, book tickets, and view booking details.
4. **Payment Integration**:
   - Support multiple payment methods (credit card, digital wallets, etc.).
5. **Notifications**:
   - Send real-time notifications for flight updates (e.g., delays, cancellations).
6. **Admin Panel**:
   - Admins can manage flights, view bookings, and generate reports.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Scalability**: Handle thousands of flights and millions of users.
2. **Reliability**: Ensure 99.9% uptime.
3. **Performance**: Low latency for flight searches and bookings.
4. **Security**: Secure user data and payment information.

## **2. High-Level Architecture**
The system follows a **microservices architecture** with the following components:
1. **Frontend**: Built using **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile apps (iOS/Android).
2. **Backend**: Built using **Spring Boot** for microservices.
3. **Database**: A combination of **PostgreSQL** (SQL) and **MongoDB** (NoSQL).
4. **Message Queue**: **Kafka** for asynchronous communication.
5. **Caching**: **Redis** for caching frequently accessed data.
6. **CDN**: **Cloudflare** for delivering static content.
7. **Real-Time Updates**: **WebSockets** for real-time notifications.

---

## **3. Component Design**

---

### **a. Flight Management**
- **Functionality**: Handles flight schedules, status updates, and real-time tracking.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured flight data.
- **APIs**:
  - `POST /flights`: Add a new flight.
  - `PUT /flights/{id}`: Update flight details.
  - `GET /flights`: Fetch flight schedules.
  - `GET /flights/{id}/status`: Fetch real-time flight status.

---

### **b. User Management**
- **Functionality**: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured user data.
- **APIs**:
  - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user.
  - `GET /profile`: Fetch user profile.

---

### **c. Booking Management**
- **Functionality**: Handles flight searches, bookings, and ticket management.
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible booking data storage.
- **APIs**:
  - `GET /search`: Search for flights based on criteria (e.g., origin, destination, date).
  - `POST /bookings`: Book a flight.
  - `GET /bookings/{id}`: Fetch booking details.
  - `DELETE /bookings/{id}`: Cancel a booking.

---

### **d. Payment Integration**
- **Functionality**: Processes payments for flight bookings.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for transaction data.
- **APIs**:
  - `POST /payments`: Process a payment.
  - `GET /payments/{id}`: Fetch payment details.

---

### **e. Notifications**
- **Functionality**: Sends real-time notifications for flight updates.
- **Technology**: WebSockets for real-time updates.
- **APIs**:
  - `POST /notifications`: Send a notification to a user.

---

### **f. Admin Panel**
- **Functionality**: Allows admins to manage flights, view bookings, and generate reports.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for admin-related data.
- **APIs**:
  - `GET /admin/flights`: Fetch all flights.
  - `GET /admin/bookings`: Fetch all bookings.
  - `GET /admin/reports`: Generate reports (e.g., revenue, occupancy).

---

## **4. Database Design**

---

### **a. PostgreSQL (SQL Database)**
- **Tables**:
  - `users`: Stores user information (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`).
  - `flights`: Stores flight information (e.g., `id`, `airline`, `origin`, `destination`, `departure_time`, `arrival_time`).
  - `payments`: Stores payment transactions (e.g., `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `status`).

---

### **b. MongoDB (NoSQL Database)**
- **Collections**:
  - `bookings`: Stores booking details (e.g., `id`, `user_id`, `flight_id`, `seats`, `status`).

---

## **5. Technologies**
- **Frontend**: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile apps).
- **Backend**: Spring Boot (for microservices).
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (SQL), MongoDB (NoSQL).
- **Message Queue**: Kafka (for asynchronous communication).
- **Caching**: Redis (for caching frequently accessed data).
- **CDN**: Cloudflare (for delivering static content).
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets (for real-time notifications).
- **Payment Gateway**: Stripe or PayPal (for payment processing).

---

## **6. System Workflow**

---

### **a. User Searches for Flights**
1. User searches for flights via the Flutter app.
2. The **Flight Service** (Spring Boot) fetches flight schedules from the PostgreSQL database.
3. The results are displayed in the Flutter app.

---

### **b. User Books a Flight**
1. User selects a flight and proceeds to book via the Flutter app.
2. The **Booking Service** (Spring Boot) creates a booking and sends it to the **Payment Service**.
3. The **Payment Service** processes the payment and updates the booking status.
4. The **Notification Service** sends a confirmation notification to the user via WebSockets.

---

### **c. Admin Manages Flights**
1. Admin logs in and adds/updates flight schedules via the Flutter app.
2. The **Flight Service** updates the flight details in the PostgreSQL database.
3. The updated flight schedules are reflected in the app for users.

---

### **d. Real-Time Flight Updates**
1. The **Flight Service** receives real-time updates (e.g., delays, cancellations) from external systems.
2. The **Notification Service** sends real-time updates to affected users via WebSockets.

---

## **7. Scalability and Reliability**

---

### **a. Horizontal Scaling**
- Use **Kubernetes** to manage and scale Spring Boot microservices.
- Use **NGINX** as a load balancer to distribute traffic.

---

### **b. Database Sharding**
- Shard the PostgreSQL database by flight ID or user ID to distribute the load.

---

### **c. Caching**
- Use **Redis** to cache frequently accessed data like flight schedules and user profiles.

---

### **d. Fault Tolerance**
- Use **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker** (e.g., Hystrix) to handle service failures gracefully.
- Use **database replication** for high availability.

---

## **8. Security**

---

### **a. Data Encryption**
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) using **AES-256**.

---

### **b. Authentication and Authorization**
- Use **Spring Security** with **OAuth 2.0** for user authentication.
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure API communication.

---

### **c. Rate Limiting**
- Implement rate limiting using **Spring Cloud Gateway** to prevent abuse.

---

## **9. Real-Time Updates**
- Use **WebSockets** in Spring Boot to push real-time updates to the Flutter app (e.g., flight delays, cancellations).

---

## **10. Summary**
This system design for a **Flight Schedule Management System** uses **Flutter** for the frontend and **Spring Boot** for the backend. It is **scalable**, **reliable**, and **secure**, leveraging modern technologies like **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **WebSockets** to handle high traffic and real-time updates.
